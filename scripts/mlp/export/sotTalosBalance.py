"""
The generators look inside a provided folder, where they expect to find 4 or 5 files:
    CoM.dat
    LeftFoot.dat
    RightFoot.dat
    WaistOrientation.dat
    optionally, ZMP.dat (if not given, it is computed from the CoM)
where the CoM and the ZMP are in the following format:
    [position3D velocity3D acceleration3D]
the feet are
    [position6D velocity6D acceleration6D]
and the waist
    [orientation3D angular_velocity3D angular_acceleration3D]
Actually, the velocity and acceleration information are only really needed for the CoM.
For all other quantities, these values are not really employed, but they are needed due
to how nd-trajectory-generator is implemented. 
What I do, is I set the arbitrarily to zero.

If you want us to be able to test the contoller with the feet admittance control too in
the near future, you may want to provide also:
    phase : zero for double support phase, positive for left support, 
    negative for right support
    rho : only useful in double support phase, a parameter defining the vertical force
    ratio between left and right foot, such that 
    rho*forceLeft + (1-rho)*forceRight = forceTotal. 
    It should range in the interval rho_min <= rho <= 1-rho_min, where rho_min > 0
